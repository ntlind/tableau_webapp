# Graphik:

## Discovery
- Why are you really here? Why go through all of this trouble?
  - Tableau is a fantastic tool for building data visualizations, but it's become bloated, slow, and expensive since the Salesforce acquisition. I want to build an alternative app that I can use to quickly build high-quality D3 visualizations. In particular, I need a better way to graph map data.
- What is the higher calling of this idea?
  - Build the de facto open source visualization software
- What about this idea excites you?
  - Great opportunity to build an Electron app
  - There aren't any easy, great map visualization tools
  - Automating the visualization discovery process: once we have a particularly data format in mind, we can auto-generate all of the interesting data visualizations for users
- What about this idea scares you?
  - That it isn't a good use of time because it'll be difficult to monetize
- What values does your company stand for?
  - Focus on learning; target engineering excellence
  - Build products that people will actually use
- How will your users add value to each other (the ultimate form of leverage)?
  - Share visualizations withone another
- On a scale of 1-10, how passionate are you to solve this problem?
  - 8   
- How much time and capital are you willing to devote to this effort?
  - No capital aside from AWS hosting costs
  - Two months of effort (by end of August)
- What are you willing to give up to make this idea work?
  - My free time
- What community of people will you begin to lead if you create this product?
  - The consulting / data analyst communities
- What theses or assumptions are you making with this idea?
  - That existing mapping tools are a pain
  - That people would use a sleeker, more refined 
- How will you get new paying customers?
  - Not planning to
- Why will your paying customers tell their friends and colleagues?
  - The product will be easy and free
- Will this business work at a scale that you can both achieve and are happy living with?
  - Yes; I don't think it will scale much
- Is it easy to start?
  - Yes
- If it is, what will keep others from starting it?
  - The people who serve this market don't have my design + engineering skills
- How do you avoid a race to the bottom where you’re trapped making a cheap commodity as a middleperson?
  - ... it's open source
- Will it get easier as you go? Why?
  - Yes; component design will be reusable
- What incentive do customers have to stick with you instead of switching to a cheaper or more convenient choice?
  - We'll be the cheapest, most convenient source
		
        
## Product Formulation
### Visioning
- Why does your product exist? What is your product's job to be done?
  - My product is for people who believe that modern "data exploration" tools create clumsy visualizations.  I will focus on people who value ease-of-use and aesthetics over comprehensive feature sets. I promise that I will help my users discover new visualization designs and patterns.
- How will the product work?
  - User will upload their data via csv, xlsx, etc.
  - They'll sort out their columns into a few data selection categories
  - They'll view a grid of potential visualizations and double-click on the one they want
  - They'll be able to change the template / theme of their visuals
- What makes your product better than anything else in the world?
  - Aesthetics / lack of clutter
  - Ease-of-use
  - It's free
  - Ease of sharing visualization with others
- What is extreme / remarkable about this idea?
  - That we could decouple visualization tools from dashboarding / reporting tools
- What challenges will we face when building this idea?
  - Building interactive features on top of D3
